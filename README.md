# Log-Analysis-Script-VRV
This project is a Python-based script that analyzes server log files to extract insights such as the number of requests per IP, the most accessed endpoint, and suspicious activity based on failed login attempts. It includes features like counting requests per IP, identifying the most accessed endpoint, and detecting IP addresses with failed login attempts exceeding a configurable threshold. The analysis results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file (`log_analysis_results.csv`) for easy reporting. To use the script, ensure Python 3.x is installed, place your log file (e.g., `sample.log`) in the same directory, and run the script using `python log_analysis.py`. The project leverages Python's file handling and regular expressions for parsing log data and uses the CSV module for exporting results. The CSV file contains detailed reports, including requests per IP, the most accessed endpoint, and suspicious activity detection. The script is modular and configurable, allowing you to adjust the threshold for detecting suspicious activities by modifying the `FAILED_LOGIN_THRESHOLD` variable.
